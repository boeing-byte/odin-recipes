        <img src="../images/carbonara.jpg" alt="A bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara" height="400" width="600">
        <p><h4>Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, 
            Pecorino Romano cheese, spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. 
            Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream, milk, garlic, or onions. 
            Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic, creamy carbonara that comes
             straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!</h4></p>
